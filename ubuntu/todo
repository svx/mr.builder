tweak fs:

tune2fs /dev/sda1 -O has_journal -o journal_data_writeback

This will disable journaling on the ext4 filesystem. Yes, a recovery after an unclean shutdown will take a bit longer. But hey, this is no mission-critical system we're building.

use something like:
blkid /dev/sda1 | awk '{print $2;}' | sed 's/"//g'

to get uuid
